# bsd-expansions

What does b-s-d stand for?

## What This Is

This is the source code for the three-word thingies that randomly appear in the header of the [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) website. Examples include:

- Bettering students daily
- Beware! Scary dragon.
- Beautiful smile. Danger!
- Building software developers.
- Bright sunny days.
- Bananas, surely delicious.
- Baaaa, said dog.
- Brilliant software, dude.

## How to Contribute

1. Add your own expansion to [expansions.txt](expansions.txt)
2. Run `npm test` (this will format and alphabetize the file)
3. Send us a pull request!

Some other suggestions:

* Be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.
* Be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
* Be novel. If your expansion starts with "Build" the other two words better be pretty great.
* Use actual words. You can't just make up random new words. Unless they're really good.
* Avoid names of people and products (other than bsd ;-))
* Avoid expansions that are gendered, sexual, aggressive, or violent. We are a diverse, positive place.
